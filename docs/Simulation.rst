Analysis
===================================

#. Simulation Success Rate (70% success for pick&place phase due to friction issues when grabbing the Brick, 95% success for Pushing phase)
#. Slowed by Technical Problems
#. Lack of Physical Testing (Not having managed to test the code on the physical robot lowered our success rate due to physics issues with gazebo environment)
